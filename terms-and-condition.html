            <h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>
            <p>4.1 Selected products may not be available for delivery to certain localities. We try our best to provide
                with such information either on the respective product page, during checkout or will communicate you
                after you place your order.</p>
            <p>4.2 We do not recommend courier deliveries to hospitals or funerals. </p>
            <p>4.3 Shipping Methods – If you wish a delivery to be made within a specific time period, you can choose
                the respective shipping method shown on the respective product page. Please note that some shipping
                methods are subject to availability and that at certain times of the year the charges for the service
                may vary. The information and the available shipping methods is always provided on the respective
                product pages when you place your order. </p>
            <p>4.4 Deliveries via courier services cannot be delivered at specific times. All orders will be delivered
                during the working day between 10am to 7pm (in the recipient time zone) during normal days (exceptions
                are such high gifting days like Valentine’s day, Mother’s day, etc during which deliveries can happen
                beyond this time range). </p>
            <p>4.5 Deliveries are available only on the days mentioned (that can be selected) in the calendar provided
                on the respective product page. If you could not choose a delivery date of your choice, it means a
                delivery is not possible on that day. Please contact our customer service team if you need any
                suggestions on any other gifts that may be available for your choice day. </p>
            <p>4.6 To avoid problems or delays with delivery, please ensure that you have provided with the full address
                details, including accurate postcode of the recipient and telephone number so that it would be easy for
                our delivery services to locate them. It would also be very helpful if you provide us with your daytime
                contact telephone number or e-mail address so that we can notify you in the event that any delivery
                problems are encountered. </p>
            <p>4.7 Certain products cannot be delivered on a specific delivery date, but will be delivered during a
                delivery period (for eg., delivery in 2-4 business days or 3-7 business days, etc.). The time it takes
                for such products to be delivered is shown on the respective product page near the shipping method area.
                Please contact our customer service for any questions you may have about delivery dates for such
                products. </p>
            <p>4.8 Whilst we agree to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that delivery will be on the requested
                delivery date or during the delivery period, you acknowledge that actual delivery will be via a local
                florist (or local gift shop, as applicable) or for certain orders via third party courier service. In
                very occasional circumstances delivery on the requested terms will not be possible, in such
                circumstances you will be given prior notice wherever possible and we shall either make alternative
                arrangements or refund your payment in full in accordance with clause mentioned above. </p>
            <p>4.9 In the case of delivery to certain locations, where a third party is involved, such as offices,
                hospitals, Funeral Directors, airports, hotels, ships and other business locations, the signature of any
                person authorised to accept delivery on behalf of the organisation shall be accepted as proof of
                delivery to your chosen recipient. </p>
            <p>4.10 Please be aware that the carrier will deliver the goods to the address provided in good faith and we
                cannot accept responsibility if the intended recipient is no longer at that address and the receiver
                refuses or fails to return the items</p>
            <p>4.11 Please note that where the carrier is unable to find someone to accept delivery, or unable to leave
                the delivery in a secure location, they will leave a card at the address for the recipient to make
                contact and re-arrange delivery. If the recipient fails to make contact in good time we reserve the
                right to charge for re-delivery to that or an alternative address. </p>
            <p>4.12 Please note that if you order a number of items for delivery to the same address, they may be
                despatched separately and we cannot guarantee delivery on the same day/time. </p>
            <p>4.13 We shall not be liable for any failure to perform in our obligations where such failure is as a
                result of Acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, hurricane or other natural disaster),
                war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), civil war,
                rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power or confiscation, terrorist activities,
                nationalisation, government sanction, blockage, embargo, labour dispute, strike, lockout or interruption
                or failure of electricity or telephone service. </p>
